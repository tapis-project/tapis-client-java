Running the client tests against Apps service running locally or in k8s
Files
 run_client_tests.sh,
 docker_run_svc.sh,
 delete_client_test_data.sh
==========================================================================
The client tests for Apps service are run using the script run_client_tests.sh.
Please see the script file for information on how to run the script and which
environment variables must be set prior to running the script.
Note that running against the k8s PROD environment is not currently supported
because the script uses SQL to cleanup DB artifacts and that seems too risky
for PROD at this point.

When running against the local service the script docker_run_svc.sh is used
to start the service and the script delete_client_test_data.sh is used to
remove test artifacts from the DB after the run.

File find_port.py

Used by jenkins job Tapis jobs -> DEV -> Java-Apps-Client-Test-Local-DEV
to find an available port when running the client tests locally.
